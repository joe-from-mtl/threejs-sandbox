<h1>Demo : Bvecs Viewer</h1>
This is an example of 15 bvecs orientation generated for a single shell with a weight=1. These points were generated using an electrostatic repulsion model to get a uniform angular coverage (see <a href="https://github.com/scilus/scilpy/blob/1992ca673492c0fbc9bde60a2e079949705c8d52/scilpy/gradientsampling/multiple_shell_energy.py#L185">GitHub/scilpy</a> for more details about the implementation. This is based on the following paper :
